# My First Post

It's the new year, and once again I'm going to try and build a site where I can put my software development stuffs.  My plan is to post 
small solutions to day-to-day problems I solve.  Simple concepts that I can refer back to at some point, and with the small hope that
someone other than me might also find it useful.

With that said here we go!
